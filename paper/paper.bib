  abstract  = "Latin binomials, popularised in the 18th century by the Swedish
               naturalist Linnaeus, have stood the test of time in providing a
               stable, clear, and memorable system of nomenclature across
               biology. However, relentless and ever-deeper exploration and
               analysis of the microbial world has created an urgent need for
               huge numbers of new names for Archaea and Bacteria. Manual
               creation of such names remains difficult and slow and typically
               relies on expert-driven nomenclatural quality control. Keen to
               ensure that the legacy of Linnaeus lives on in the age of
               microbial genomics and metagenomics, we propose an automated
               approach, employing combinatorial concatenation of roots from
               Latin and Greek to create linguistically correct names for
               genera and species that can be used off the shelf as needed. As
               proof of principle, we document over a million new names for
               Bacteria and Archaea. We are confident that our approach
               provides a road map for how to create new names for decades to
               come.",

               Nomenclature of Prokaryotes that was presented in draft form and
               available for comment at the Plenary Session of the Fourteenth
               International Congress of Bacteriology and Applied Microbiology
               (BAM), Montr{\'e}al, 2014, together with updated lists of
               conserved and rejected bacterial names and of Opinions issued by
               the Judicial Commission. As in the past it brings together those
               changes accepted, published and documented by the ICSP and the
               Judicial Commission since the last revision was published.
               Several new appendices have been added to this edition. Appendix
               11 addresses the appropriate application of the Candidatus
               concept, Appendix 12 contains the history of the van Niel Prize,
               and Appendix 13 contains the summaries of Congresses. The
               full-text version of this article contains chapters 1-4 of the
               Code, and their associated references. All other material,
               including foreword, prefaces, and appendices, can be found in
